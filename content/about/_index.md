I’m not just a DevOps engineer — I’m someone who believes in **engineering reliability at scale**, where automation isn’t a choice but a culture.  
Every system I touch, I aim to make it **resilient, observable, and future-ready**.  

💡 For me, **DevOps = Art + Engineering**. It’s about painting stability with automation, coding pipelines that feel alive, and turning infrastructure into something as seamless as software.
