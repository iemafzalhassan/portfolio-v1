# Deployment Test - Token Fix

This page is testing the deployment after fixing the GitHub token configuration.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Token Parameter**: Changed from `github_token` to `personal_token`
2. **External Repository**: Using `DEPLOY_TOKEN` for cross-repository deployment
3. **Hugo Version**: Updated to 0.148.2 for compatibility

## Expected Results

- âœ… GitHub Actions should complete successfully
- âœ… Site should deploy to portfolio-pages repository
- âœ… Slack notifications should be sent
- âœ… Custom domain should work

## Current Status

If you can see this page, the automated deployment is working correctly! ðŸŽ‰

The token configuration is now properly set up for cross-repository deployment.
