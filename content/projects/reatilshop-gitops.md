## üè™ Retail Store Sample App - GitOps with EKS Auto Mode

A comprehensive sample application demonstrating modern DevOps practices and GitOps principles on AWS EKS. This project showcases a complete retail store application with microservices architecture, automated deployment pipelines, and infrastructure as code.

### üéØ Project Overview

This retail store application is designed to illustrate various concepts related to containers on AWS, presenting a complete e-commerce solution including product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout functionality. The project demonstrates modern DevOps practices including GitOps, Infrastructure as Code, and automated CI/CD pipelines.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture

#### **Application Services**
- **UI Service**: Java-based frontend application
- **Catalog Service**: Go-based product catalog API
- **Cart Service**: Java-based shopping cart API
- **Orders Service**: Java-based order management API
- **Checkout Service**: Node.js-based checkout orchestration API

#### **Infrastructure Stack**
- **Container Orchestration**: Amazon EKS with Auto Mode
- **GitOps**: ArgoCD for automated deployments
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for AWS resources
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated builds
- **Container Registry**: Amazon ECR (both public and private)
- **Ingress**: NGINX Ingress Controller
- **SSL**: Cert Manager for automated certificates

### üöÄ Key Features
